I got a reply, saying they got the email on 15th of March. Then on 28th of April I got another letter, that I have an appointment for 20th of May.

On the Id forms you need to provide that information, or that you are self-employed. No brainer for me, that time. But life is life, I quit that job, I already had the appointment when it happened. I knew I will move to the self-employed status, so all my submitted forms are wrong now. But the appointment mail says print and bring everything you sent or you won‚Äôt get the Id. Ok, I started to get the stuff needed for self-employment see https://jobsplus.gov.mt/ and I brought that with me next to the originally submitted stuff. When it was my turn in the office, I gave them the copies and told them that my situation changed recently. The lady looked confused or panicking at first, said this is wrong, I need to submit a new application. We went through how I got here keeping in mind the situation changed really close to the appointment. She suddenly disappeared for about 10 minutes, came back, noted the change on my prints. Probably I will need to do more around the self-employment stuff but that is another round.
