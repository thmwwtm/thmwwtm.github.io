      <description>I wanted to try gohugo for a long time now, as I wanted to do more go stuff, even if it is just using it. Also, hugo has quite good benchmarks. (And luckily I need to use some go at work)
Other points I wanted to fulfill:
 use GitHub pages (static) use markdown for editing  and hugo is good for both.
I wanted to use markdown because I like to write docs in md, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need an editor for that, I can do it on my phone, or any computer.</description>
