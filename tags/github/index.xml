      <description>I wanted to try Github actions since it got announced. Finally I had it on my foreseeable list when I started this blog, and lately, I did it. üëè üéâüéÜ I got to a working pipeline in 25 tries, lets go through each step how it improved piece by piece.
I started to work on it at night, thinking it would not take long. (hehe, famous last words). After around 20 failed runs, I went to sleep.</description>

      <description>I wanted to try gohugo for a long time now, as I wanted to do more go stuff, even if it is just using it. Also, hugo has quite good benchmarks. (And luckily I need to use some go at work)
Other points I wanted to fulfill:
use GitHub pages (static) use markdown for editing and hugo is good for both.
I wanted to use markdown because I like to write docs in md, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need an editor for that, I can do it on my phone, or any computer.</description>
