      <description>Logistics lvl 9000+ The monthly schedule of the transportation company was on 27th February, meaning they arrive to Malta on 1st March at night, and they collect the packages days before departure. Before I left we already had a lot of boxes filled, but my partner had another lot of left. On 25th of February the package collection happened.

      <description>First of all the culture of the real estate agents is much better here than at home. At least what I experienced. I asked three agents to look for a new home for us. All of them gave me multiple possibilities and looked for new ones immediately if I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the first. They took me from door to door, by own car, paying a quite expensive Bolt ride and once (it was my first week) I asked if we can go by bus, so I try that too, and she insisted on paying my ticket.</description>
