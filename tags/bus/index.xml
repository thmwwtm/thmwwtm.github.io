      <description>Public transport Aka buses, also some ferries but focus on land for now. You may have heard the legend that buses on Malta are unreliable. I heard that too, but luckily I never experienced it. There are routes with narrow roads there are only a few bus lanes, so in high traffic, the possibility is quite high buses will be jammed. I mostly go on foot, but when I had to go to further localities by bus I was satisfied.</description>
