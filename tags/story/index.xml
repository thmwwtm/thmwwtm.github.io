      <description>Public transport Aka buses, also some ferries but focus on land for now. You may have heard the legend that buses on Malta are unreliable. I heard that too, but luckily I never experienced it. There are routes with narrow roads there are only a few bus lanes, so in high traffic, the possibility is quite high buses will be jammed. I mostly go on foot, but when I had to go to further localities by bus I was satisfied.</description>

      <description>Logistics lvl 9000+ The monthly schedule of the transportation company was on 27th February, meaning they arrive to Malta on 1st March at night, and they collect the packages days before departure. Before I left we already had a lot of boxes filled, but my partner had another lot of left. On 25th of February the package collection happened.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked abroad for quite some time. I got used to traveling. I made it easy for myself. I do not have too much stuff and I do not require too much to feel comfortable or at least &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo;.
But now I am not alone what makes the relocation a bit more difficult.
My partner has ten times more luggage than I, and our dog can not be moved by airplane.</description>

      <description>Who writes it why and what will be here?
If the title does not ring a bell you need to see this:   Who I am a software developer from Hungary. After a while I felt the urge to leave my current enterprise position, and for some time already I had the idea to maybe try something abroad.
I started to work with software somewhere in high school, then I was intern, worked at small company, startup incubator, startup, bigger company and enterprise.</description>
