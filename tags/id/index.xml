      <description>I started working at a Maltese company before I arrived in Malta. When I found what will be my permanent address, I started to fill more and more forms.
Social security number This is one of the easiest. You can do it online, fill in 2 pages, submit, you get a confirmation mail, then in few days also in the mail you have your SSN. Here you find detailed instructions and at the bottom the link to the form.</description>
